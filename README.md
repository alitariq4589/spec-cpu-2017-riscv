# spec-cpu-2017-riscv
This repository includes config files for running SPEC CPU 2017 benchmarks on RISC-V SBC and QEMU RISC-V (QEMU System as well as QEMU User mode).

As QEMU user mode is usually run on a different architecture than for which it executes, so there must be some modifications made accordingly.
